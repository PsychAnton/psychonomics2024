# My Research
Cognitive-motor interference research investigates how postural control demands affect cognitive task performance and vice versa. We measure postural control parameters continuously with a force-plate during quiet standing while participants do different cognitive tasks and analyse them in an event-related manner. Our main focus is on a dual-task paradigm in which we generate a memory consolidation bottleneck which interferences with postural processes.

# Abstract
 Cognitive-processing demands can affect postural control processes. Traditional methods of analysing postural control aggregate sway data, making it difficult to isolate the specific influence of cognitive processes on postural control. Recently, postural-control parameters were measured continuously with a force plate during standing and analysed in an event-related approach while participants completed a Simon Task. Resolving response conflict in the Simon Task reduced variability in postural control prior to the manual response. In the present study, this event-related approach is used during a cognitive dual task to explore how cognitive processes involved in executing two tasks in rapid succession influence postural control processes. The dual task comprises a visual-vocal short-term memory task with a delayed vocal response and an auditory-manual reaction time (RT) task. We manipulated the stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA: 100 vs. 1,000 ms) between the stimuli (Experiment 1) and whether participants had to report or ignore the visual object (task load: ignore vs. report; Experiment 2). These were applied on a trial-by-trial basis or in blocks of predictable versus unpredictable task load (Experiment 3). RTs in the auditory-manual RT task were longer during short compared to long SOA, suggesting a bottleneck caused by encoding the visual object for later report. This bottleneck disappeared in predictable ignore trials, when the visual object was never relevant. Assessing the postural correlates revealed no process-specific influence of SOA on postural control processes, but a reduction of sway variability after visual target onset in report but not in ignore trials. Moreover, a difference in sway variability over the course of a trial in report vs. ignore trials occurred in predictable blocks only. We propose a Dynamic Cognitive-Motor Interference Model (DCMI) which describes the influence of capacity limited cognitive processes and their influence on postural control processes. Furthermore, it takes the temporal modulation of cognitiv-motor interference as well as the predictive and adaptive character of postural control adjustments into account.
